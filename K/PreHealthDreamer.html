              <h2>The Effect of Turbulence and Bioclogging on the Nutrient Removal Potential of Hyporheic Zones</h2>
              <p>
                Hyporheic exchange (HE) contributes immensely to carbon and nitrogen cycling in rivers. At the bedform scale, HE is driven by turbulence and localized pressure gradients (advective pumping). However, most numerical models for hyporheic nutrient dynamics are based on steady-state advective exchange. We hypothesize that these assumptions omit important features of hyporheic nutrient cycling because turbulence accounts for an important fraction of solute transport through the sediment-water interface while microbial growth alters flow through the hyporheic zone. To assess the effects of these processes on the location of denitrification hotspots and the magnitude of carbon and nitrogen transformation rates, we present a modeling framework in OpenFOAM® that couples hyporheic
                flow, biochemical transformations (metabolism of carbon, nitrification and denitrification) and bioclogging from the associated microbial growth. We integrate Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) of the surface water flow over bedforms to capture the unsteady nature of turbulence as a HE driver. Comparisons of results obtained under steady and unsteady hydraulic conditions are used to quantify the effects of turbulence that are left out under steady-state assumptions. Direct comparison of the simulated reaction rate fields indicates the effects of unsteadiness from turbulence and bioclogging on the distribution of nutrient transformation hotspots. Moreover, time series of net oxygen and carbon consumption and net nitrate balances are used to determine the extent to which
                steady-state models underestimate the overall reactivity of hyporheic zones for carbon and nitrogen cycling in rivers.

              <h2>WWTP-Wastewater treatment survelliance project</h2>
              <p>
                Estimating the prevalence of COVID-19 in a community is useful for public health resource allocation, policy making, and messaging. As COVID-19 becomes endemic in the community it is essential to have passive indicators that do not depend on clinical testing data. Our team is worki.ng with public health departments to use wastewater to monitor COVID-19 prevalence in communities throughout Illinois. Other targets such as flu, polio, and opioids can also be tracked using wastewater epidemiology. We have developed data analysis methods to improve the predictive power of wastewater from treatment plants in the Chicago area. In this project, we will expand the analysis to wastewater treatment plans throughout Illinois and incorporate additional data streams such as wastewater
                quality measurements. This project primarily involves coding and statistical analysis with opportunities in dynamical systems modeling and machine learning.

              <h2>Sustainable Solution Competition, ASCE 2021</h2>
              <p>Design green buildings and social activities on campus area during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
              <p>This project combines Chinese elements with modern regional management and development needs, provides ASCE University’s teachers and students with a regional service featuring Chinese culture of harmony between people and nature, and opens up a new world in the middle field of sustainable development between man and nature.</p>
              <p>The layout of the entire site is shown here. Connected to the external road respectively, a north-south layered cycle path and sidewalk, subtly divide the whole site into two parts . The cafe and the large lawn provide the needs for outdoor social entertainment, while the woodworking cabin and the scientific research center provide community members with a platform for practice and innovation.</p>
              <p>In order to preserve the surface ecology of the original site, we applied some special overhead treatment for all buildings, structures and roads. By installing these pillars, we raised the overall height by 30-40cm. Through the overhead design, we minimize the loss to the surface soil and maintain the original surface runoff state. Moreover, it gives small animals a smooth passage space, which helps to protect ecological diversity.</p>
              <p>Considering the overall features of outdoor entertainment of the whole site, our team came up with a way of separating people and vehicles and layered interlacing in the design of the road. With the separation of people and vehicles, bicycles can pass quickly on the ground, and in the meantime, the chance of traffic accidents is reduced and the safety of pedestrians is ensured. The one-way two-lane design of the road separates the crowd traffic flow and reduces the risk of epidemic spread.</p>
              <p>To collect and recycle rain water and runoff on the site, we designed a pool at the point of lowest elevation. The bottom of the pool is connected with the underground pipe gallery, and water can be used flexibly per demand. At the same time, as an important feature in Chinese classical garden culture, the pool also enhances landscape effect and plays a role in improving the small-scale thermal environment as well. Water quality can be monitored in real time by stocking water quality sensitive fish.</p>
